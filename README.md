### JsDesignPatterns

- Simply wrap all javascript design patterns in one project with example, a little bit of explanation.

### Content
- There will be 3 folders for each type of design patterns.
- creational-designpattern
- behavioral-designpattern
- structural-designpattern

### Types of design patterns
- Creational patterns focus on ways to create objects or classes. This may sound simple (and it is in some cases), but large applications need to control the object creation process.
- Structural design patterns focus on ways to manage relationships between objects so that your application is architected in a scalable way. A key aspect of structural patterns is to ensure that a change in one part of your application does not affect all other parts.
- Behavioral patterns focus on communication between objects
